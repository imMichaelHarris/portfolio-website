									<h3 class="major">Past</h3>
									<p>Hey!! Welcome to my website. About me...well I started to code in 2017 with a programming language Python. Now then I was only actively programming for about a month until I stopped. Why did I stop? Well you see I wasn't having fun with Python. So I just gave up learning it. Now i always thought programming looked cool and I wished I found it fun, but I thought to myself, did I quit learning because I wasn't having fun or was it just became to hard for me to understand. So after about half a year later I decided to continue learning only this time going on a different path...Web Development
									</p>

									<p>This time I told myself I would not quit as soon as I came across subjects I couldn't grasp immediately. Starting with HTML and CSS I quickly realized that web development was amazing and even though I kept hitting walls with JavaScript I didn't stop learning because I discovered that the only way you truly fail is if you stop trying. As a web developer you are always learning, which I now love to learn. I am proud of the progress I've made and look forward to the future successes and failures. Every day I code there is a new challenge. Sometimes it gets very frustrating and I want to weep in the corner (looking at you JavaScript) but I remember to stick to it.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Present</h3>
									<p>I'm currently enrolled in Lambda School to accelerate my learning to become a Full Stack Web Developer. When I'm not coding and trying to grasp new ideas and languages, I like to play music. Typically I jam on the guitar but I'll sometimes go on the keys and play a couple chords there but the guitar definitely has my heart. Who knows..maybe one day I'll learn how to sing haha. Thanks for visiting my site, I look forward to implementing new concepts and technologies that I learn here.</p>
